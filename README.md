# Transformerencoder

I use PyTorch to complete my encoder.
The purpose of this model is to address the current research project I am working on.

## normal
- In this version, is a Transformer encoder with an up-sampling method.
And use Optuna for trying different parameter adjustments.

## bagging
- I use random sampling to do this bagging ensemble.
  In this imbalanced case, the majority of samples can be balanced with the minority samples through under-sampling.
