# Transformerencoder

I use PyTorch to complete my encoder, the data preprocess might need to do by yourself.

## normal
- In this version, is a Transformer encoder with an up-sampling method.
  And also use Optuna. 

## bagging
- I use random sampling to do this bagging ensemble.
  In this imbalanced case, the majority of samples can be balanced with the minority samples through under-sampling.
